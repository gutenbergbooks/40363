<h2>APE.</h2>


<p>Apes play many odd tricks, and try to
act like men, for they are very fond of
imitating every thing they see. They are
also very mischievous, and sometimes
spiteful, so they should be either tied up
in a safe place or well watched.</p>

<p>Apes are a species of monkeys. They
live in a country called Africa, where
there are a great many forests, and where
the trees are much larger than any in
the settled parts of America. The apes
can climb to the top of the very tallest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>
trees, and cling to the branches in safety.
They are very quick in their motions,
and can fling themselves from tree to
tree with great readiness, holding on with
their long arms and legs. In their native
woods, they are very wild; they go
on all fours; and sometimes visit the
Negroes' huts and fight hard battles with
the inhabitants, throwing sticks and
branches with great dexterity. They are
usually of a dull brown color, but some
are black, and others grey. They should
be fed upon bread soaked in water, and
any kind of fruit that may be convenient
to give them; they are very fond of nuts
and biscuit, both of which may be given
them in moderation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span></p>
<h2>BEAR.</h2>


<p>The bear is found in Europe and North
America, but it is among the icy regions
around the North Pole, that he attains
his greatest size and fierceness. One of
his principal modes of attack is the employment
of his fore-legs in hugging his
enemy, and few creatures can resist the
crushing embrace of a large bear.</p>

<p>The people of the cold countries, where
he mostly lives, make bedding and
clothing of the skins, and either eat the
fat or melt it into oil for their lamps.
Bears, when at rest, are in the habit of
constantly sucking their paws, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
curious custom has puzzled many wise
men to explain.</p>

<p>The bear is a good swimmer, and often
takes to the water; he climbs well, but
in descending trees always comes down
backwards. His sight is sharp, and his
hearing and smelling is excellent. He
walks easily on his hind-legs, and in
that position can support heavy burdens.
Though his gait is awkward, he can, if
he pleases, go at a great pace. He is
said to grow to about his twentieth and
live to his fiftieth year. Some bears are
black, others brown, and a few grey, but
those in cold countries are always white.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span></p>
<h2>COW.</h2>


<p>The cow is a very useful, and well
known animal. The cow furnishes us
with an abundance of good sweet milk,
which we put into our tea and coffee, or
make into butter and cheese. The flesh
is most excellent food, and is called beef.
England is a famous country for beef,
which is of such a good quality that the
people have an old song about it, called
the "Roast beef of old England." The
hide is made into leather, and is much
used in the making of shoes.</p>

<p>The cow is a very quiet animal, and
will hurt no body, it feeds upon grass,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
which it swallows and brings up again
before digesting it, and chews a very long
while, and on that account is called a
ruminating animal.</p>

<p>Cows are of different colors, some red,
white, black, and others spotted. The
cow will live to the age of fourteen or
fifteen years, and its age may be known
by the rings or knots on its horns, for a
new ring grows every year. A great
many country people are employed in
selling milk to the people of large cities
and towns, and are called "milk people."
Before the white people came to America
there were no cows, but now they are
raised in great numbers, especially in the
eastern country.</p>

<h2>DOG.</h2>


<p>Dogs are most faithful, attached creatures.
They are of all sizes, from the
large Newfoundland dog, as big nearly
as a donkey, down to the little lap-dog,
no bigger than a kitten. Dogs are of
various colors, and their skins of all kinds,
the hair sometimes smooth and close,
like a grey hound's; sometimes very
rough and shaggy, as in the Scotch terrier;
sometimes smooth and flowing, like
silk, as in a spaniel.</p>

<p>They are soon taught to be obedient,
and become very clever. The shepherd's
dog knows every sheep in the flock. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>
house dog knows the sound of his master's
footsteps. The Newfoundland dog
will rush into the water to save any one
from drowning. There are many interesting
stories about dogs, which will
please you very much to read when you
are older and better able to understand
them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span></p>
<h2>ELEPHANT.</h2>


<p>How heavy and clumsy the elephant
looks! yet he is very active, and able to
do many things with neatness. If you
hold a sixpence in your hand, he will
take it up in his large trunk, and place
it where the keeper tells him. With the
same trunk he is able to tear up large
trees, and to strike so hard that the blow
would kill a man. In foreign countries
he is used to ride upon, as we ride upon
horses. He is a very good swimmer.
He is born chiefly in warm climates.
His tusks are ivory, and are very useful
for handles of knives, and many other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
things. His trunk serves him instead
of a hand to feed himself with, and to
hold and carry what he pleases.</p>

<p>He is very clever, and soon learns to
do whatever he is taught. His temper
and nature are kind, but when he is
teased he becomes very fierce. He eats
grass and hay, but no flesh.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span></p>
<h2>FISHER.</h2>


<p>This is the name of an animal found
in the northern and middle states of
our country, and in Canada. He is
called the fisher, by the hunters, probably
from his frequenting the lakes and
river shores. But he does not catch fish
like the otter. He robs the traps of the
hunter of their captured or dead game,
and he kills squirrels, rabbits, and wood
chucks. In the picture he is represented
as killing a rabbit.</p>

<p>The fisher was formerly abundant in
the state of New York, but he is seldom
found there now. He was greatly detested<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
by the hunters, on account of his
robbing their traps of beaver and other
valuable game. His flesh is unfit for
food, and his fur is of very trifling value.</p>

<h2>GOATS.</h2>


<p>We have not many goats in America, but
you will sometimes see them about the
houses of poor people who live on the out-skirts
of large towns and villages. They
abound in many foreign countries, chiefly
those which are wild, and have high hills
and mountains. These, let them be ever
so high, the goat climbs very nimbly and
safely. The goat is a very useful creature.
Its young are called kids, and its
flesh is very good to eat; out of its skin
we make good leather for shoes and
gloves. The goat's milk is pleasant to
drink, and to make cheese from. It eats<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>
herbs and delights to nibble the bark of
trees. You will often read in the Bible,
that goats in ancient times were offered
as sacrifices. In Switzerland they have
a kind of wild goat, called the chamois.
The cut below represents some Swiss
hunters pursuing the chamois over rocks
and mountains.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span></p>
<h2>HYENA.</h2>


<p>The hyena is one of the most fierce
and disagreeable of all animals. The
hyena is by nature a nocturnal animal;
that is, it seeks its prey by night, and
consequently during the day it remains
in a state of repose. The hyena has
been unfairly represented to be perfectly
untameable on account of its great ferocity.
If properly treated, however, and
well fed, it is far from being savage or
dangerous.</p>

<p>It possesses a great propensity for putrid
and buried carcasses, which it will
hunt, and dig for, and devour with disgusting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
greediness. Unlike many other
animals, the hyena is an unsociable animal,
for it lives a solitary life among
rocks and ancient ruins. There are two
kinds of hyenas, the spotted and the
striped. The figure below represents the
striped, and the other represents the
spotted hyena.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span></p>
<h2>IBEX.</h2>


<p>The ibex is an animal of the goat kind,
and inhabits the mountainous districts
of the south of Europe, it is the most
graceful of all its tribes; it is extremely
active. It is very wild, and difficult
to be shot, as it always keeps on
the highest points. The horns of the
ibex are large and knotty, its skin is of
a yellow color, and its beard short and
black. The chase of the ibex, although
it is not a very powerful animal, is attended,
at times, with considerable
danger; it has been known, when driven
hard, to run full-but at the huntsman,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>
and force him over the rock, although in
doing so, it has at the same time, sacrificed
its own life, falling headlong with
its pursuer. The ibex is said to be a
short-lived animal. Its flesh is much
esteemed, and its skin is very thin.</p>

<p>Below is a picture of a bear pursuing
a male and female ibex.</p>

<p class="center"><img src="images/i039.jpg" alt="ibex" width="300" height="230" /></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span></p>
<h2>JERBOA.</h2>


<p>This odd-looking creature has been
also called the two-legged rat; its fore-legs
being so extremely small that they
can hardly be seen, while the hind-legs
are of enormous length. The tail is long
and tufted at the end. Its general appearance
closely resembles the rat. Instead
of walking or running on all
fours, it leaps, or hops, on the hind
feet, making great bounds, and only
uses the fore-paw for burrowing, or for
carrying food to its mouth, like a
squirrel. These curious little animals
live in holes which they dig under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>
ground. They are gentle, harmless,
and not at all timid. Their dwelling
places are very quiet, for they never
fight or quarrel with one another, like
some very bad children I could tell you
about.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span></p>
<h2>KANGAROO.</h2>


<p>This curious animal, called a Kangaroo,
hops on his hind-legs, which are
very long; his fore-legs are short, and
he has a very long hard tail. Kangaroos
herd together in great numbers, for
they are very timid creatures. At the
least alarm they will run away, and leap
over high bushes. They use their short
fore feet for digging, and putting food in
their mouths. They feed upon vegetables
and grass, and do not eat flesh. The
mother carries her young ones about her
in a sort of pouch.</p>

<p>The kangaroo is brought from a very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
large island, a great many thousand
miles from here. We have some in this
country, which you may see by going to
the Menagerie, where the keeper will
tell you a great many stories about them.
Their nature is not at all fierce. The
picture below shows the manner in which
the kangaroo leaps.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span></p>
<h2>LEOPARD.</h2>


<p>The leopard is a beautiful animal.
He is of a yellowish fawn color, marked
with black spots of different sizes. This
animal in its habits and appearance
much resembles a cat. He is very fierce
and savage. He preys upon those
animals which are weaker than himself.
He always avoids man, except
when closely pursued, when he offers an
obstinate resistance. From the extraordinary
flexibility of his limbs, he can climb
a tree as readily as a cat. When taken
young, he can be tamed to a certain degree.</p>

<p>The flesh of the leopard is said to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>
excellent, resembling veal. The skins
are very valuable, and often sell for upwards
of fifty dollars. The picture below
represents a leopard watching a herd
of antelopes. He is hid from their view
behind a rock, and when they come near
enough, he will leap into the herd and
catch one of them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span></p>
<h2>MOOSE.</h2>


<p>This animal is perhaps the only kind
of deer whose general appearance can
be called ungraceful. The head is large,
the mane short and thick, and the horns
knotty and heavy. The body, which is
short and clumsy, is mounted on tall
legs. The motion of the animal is a sort
of shambling trot. The moose inhabits
the northern parts of both Europe and
America. Its flesh is much liked by the
hunters, and much resembles beef.</p>

<p>The moose attains to a large size, particularly
the male, which sometimes
weighs eleven or twelve hundred pounds.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>
Their skins, when dressed properly, make
a soft, thick, pliable leather, which is
useful for many purposes. Sometimes
the moose is attacked by wolves. Here
you have a picture of an unfortunate
moose, who is assailed by a whole band
of wolves. One is on his back, and has
his teeth in the poor moose's flesh.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span></p>
<h2>NYL GHAU.</h2>


<p>This animal is a kind of antelope, but
is larger than the usual size of the antelope,
and not so handsome in form. It
stands upwards of four feet in height at
the shoulder. It is a powerful and
vicious creature, and its temper is not
good. When it is about to make an attack,
it drops down upon its fore-legs,
and then darts quickly forward and gives
a blow with its head, which is very dangerous.
The hair of the nyl ghau is
short and close, and is generally of a
slate color in the male, and a tawny red
in the female, except in the under parts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>
of the body, which are always white. Its
fore-legs are longer than its hinder-legs,
and it has the appearance of having a
small lump at its shoulder. It is usually
found in the forests of India, where it
becomes the prey of the tigers and wild
boars. The cut below shows how the
nyl ghau defends himself when attacked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span></p>
<h2>OX.</h2>


<p>The ox is very much like the bull and
the cow in form, size, and color, and
lives in the fields as they do. As soon
as he is large enough, he is made to work
for man; he draws the plough and the
wagon, and in old times used to tread
out the corn, instead of thrashing as
people do now. He is not so wild or
fierce as the bull, but its flesh and hide
are as useful to us. The ox's foot is of a
horny substance, and is called a hoof,
like that of the bull and the cow. It is not
like the horse's hoof, because it is separated
in two. The horns of the ox are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>
made into combs, drinking cups, handles
for knives, and other things. The blood
of the ox is very useful, and when boiled
with brown sugar it helps to make it
white. The blood also makes a blue dye.
Boys should not tease an ox, or throw
stones at him. Sometimes they turn on
their tormentors, and gore them with
their horns.</p>

<h2>PORCUPINE.</h2>


<p>This is an animal of whom the most
ridiculous stories have been told, particularly
as to its power of darting its
quills to a considerable distance when
attacked, and in this manner wounding
its enemies. Instead, however of being
an enemy to be feared, there is not, perhaps,
a more timid creature in existence.
But still, as a means of defence, these
quills are of great service to their possessor,
and preserve it from the attack
of most of its enemies; its teeth are very
strong and sharp; and if it had courage
enough to use them, it would become<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
rather a dangerous foe. When full grown,
it measures nearly two feet in length.
Its general color is a grizzled, dusky
black. The upper part of the head and
neck is furnished with long light hairs.
Most parts of the back and sides are
armed with long, sharp pointed quills,
which are raised in a threatening manner
whenever the animal is excited. The
porcupine sleeps during the day, and at
night searches for food. Below is a picture
of an odd kind of porcupine. It is
called a Brazilian porcupine.</p>

<h2>QUAGGA.</h2>


<p>This animal is somewhat like the horse,
but most like the zebra, as you may see
by comparing the two together. It is
found in the southern parts of Africa,
living mostly in the plains in large herds.
It is not so large or so beautiful as the
zebra. Its skin is of a dull brownish
white, striped with darker color on the
head and neck, and somewhat on the
sides of its body; the upper parts of its
legs are greyish, and the under parts
white. It is a wild creature, and rather
vicious in temper. It is made to draw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>
by the natives of the country where it is
found, and its flesh is eaten by them.</p>

<p>The quagga differs from the zebra in
his stripes. You may see by the figure
of the zebra, below, that he is striped all
over his body and limbs, while the quagga
has stripes only on the head and the
fore part of the body.</p>

<h2>RABBIT.</h2>


<p>Rabbits are timid little animals, prettily
formed, with beautiful long ears.
They run swiftly, and jump very nimbly.
Wild rabbits live in woods and burrow
holes in banks of earth, where they hide
themselves from danger. The wild rabbits
are of a greyish brown color, but
the tame rabbits are white, black, brown,
black and white, and reddish. The white
have pink eyes. Their fur is soft, and is
used for making hats. Their flesh is
white and very good to eat. The tame
rabbits are kept in very small huts, and
little boys and girls are fond of feeding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>
them, for they will eat out of their hand,
carrots, lettuce, and other green vegetables.
Below is a picture of a pretty
kind of tame rabbits with very long ears.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span></p>
<h2>SHEEP.</h2>


<p>The sheep is perhaps the most useful
animal we have in our country; the flesh,
called mutton, is most wholesome food.
The hair of the skin, called wool, is made
into cloth, flannel, and worsted. The
skin is made into parchment to write
upon, and leather; and from other parts
of its body are made the strings for harps
and violins, &amp;c. The finest wool is procured
from the sheep which are bred in
Spain. The sheep is very timid and
harmless, and lives as you often may see
in flocks, feeding on the grass of the fields
and mountains. The hills and mountains<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>
which are too steep and barren for
growing corn afford pasturage for the
sheep. It very soon knows the shepherd
who is set over it, and is easily
guided by him. The young of the sheep
are called lambs. Here is a picture of a
Scotch shepherd keeping sheep in the
Highlands.</p>

<h2>TIGER.</h2>


<p>This very beautiful animal, is called a
tiger, and is a native of India, a very hot
country in Asia. Tigers are very fierce,
and will often kill men, and animals a
great deal larger than themselves. They
live in the woods and thickets, called
jungles, where they are hunted. Tigers
eat the flesh of animals which they kill.
We have none in America, except a few
carried about for show. The tiger is as
big as a lion, and like the cat in shape,
but much larger; he has a long tail, and
a handsome striped skin, covered with
short hair, which is used for a variety of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>
useful and ornamental purposes. He is
very active and can spring far. The
tiger has sometimes been tamed by menagerie
keepers, but he is a very sly and
dangerous creature, and never to be
trusted.</p>

<h2>URUS.</h2>


<p>This name is given to the wild buffalo,
of which there are several kinds.
The one represented by our picture is
the Cape Buffalo, which is found in various
parts of Southern Africa. He is a
very formidable animal, with spiteful
looking eyes, and strong, crooked, sharp
horns. He is very strong and hard to
kill. The hunters consider him a worse
enemy than the lion or the tiger.</p>

<p>This buffalo loves to wallow in pools
and swamps, and when the hunters attack
him, he charges upon them with his
terrible horns, and often overturns a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>
horse and his rider, trampling them under
his feet, and goring them with his
sharp horns.</p>

<p>Mr. Cumming, the English traveller
in South Africa, often encountered these
animals, and had severe battles with
them.</p>

<p>Here is a picture of the American
bison, which is commonly called a Buffalo.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span></p>
<h2>VICUGNA.</h2>


<p>The vicugna has sometimes been called
the Chilian sheep, from the name of the
country it inhabits. It is covered with
a fine, valuable wool, which is of a red
rose color on the back, but white on the
other parts of the body. Vicugnas congregate
in large herds, and feed on grass
and small shrubs, and so long as they
can procure enough of such food, they are
never known to drink. They are very
timid, but swift and sure at running.
Their legs are slender and well formed,
and the head tall and erect. Their ears
are long and pointed, and their eyes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>
large and brilliant. From the form of
their feet, they are well fitted to travel
mountainous countries, and are said to
be even safer than mules. The vicugna
is upwards of five feet in height and six
in length. The tame ones will carry a
load of over fifty pounds, but they are
kept principally for the sake of the wool,
and the flesh, which is said to taste like
mutton. Here is a picture of the llama,
which is like the vicugna in many respects.</p>

<h2>WOLF.</h2>


<p>The wolf is something like a large dog.
He is very fierce, and carries off young
lambs and kids, which he kills and eats.
Throughout Europe there are still many
wolves, and the shepherds have great
trouble to drive them away from the
places where their sheep feed. We see
in this picture that the wolf has killed a
lamb, and is going to eat him.</p>

<p>We have no wolves in the settled
portions of our country, for the whites
hunted and killed them all, because they
were such troublesome and dangerous
neighbors. But in the western country,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>
and among the forests and mountains,
they are still pretty plenty. Wolves go
about in large packs, or companies, and
having scented their prey, pursue it like
a pack of hounds, uttering the most dismal
and ferocious cries.</p>

<p>Below is a picture of a wolf and two
cubs.</p>

<p>We could not procure the drawing of

this letter.</p>

<hr class="full" />


<h2>YAK.</h2>


<p>This animal is seldom seen in Europe,
but it is a common one in Tartary, where
it is a native. It is like a small ox in
its size and form, and has horns and
hoofs. Like the ox it is used sometimes
as a beast of burden. Its colors are
chiefly black and white. The hair is
long and rather curly, particularly at its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>
tail. The Chinese make ornaments out
of the hair of the tails, which they dye
various colors and wear them in their
bonnets. The Turks and Persians use
the tails as we do flags, for war-standards,
which they call "horse tails."</p>

<p>The hump on the back of the yak,
like that of the bison, is formed of flesh,
better flavored and more palatable than
any other part of the animal. Hence it
is esteemed a great delicacy, and is much
prized by the natives of the countries
where it is found.</p>

<h2>ZEBU.</h2>


<p>The zebu is an animal of the cow kind,
and a native of India, and on that account
is often called the Indian ox.
There are many varieties of the zebu.
Some of them are as large as our largest
oxen. Others when full grown are no
bigger than a small calf. Its horns are
short and thick, and bent a little backwards;
there is also a lump on the
shoulder, which makes it look clumsy.
It is a very useful and docile animal.
In India it is used as a common beast
of burden; it is also made to draw light
wagons, and is even used for riding.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span></p>

<p>The Zebu is found not only in India,
but in China, Eastern Africa, and the
East India Islands. Figures representing
the zebu are found on some of the
most ancient monuments of that country.
The Brahmins esteem the zebu a sacred
animal; and for this reason it has received
the name of the Brahmin ox.</p>

<p>The picture below, shows several different
kinds of zebus.</p>

<h2>THE MARMOT.</h2>


<p>The Alpine Marmot inhabits the Alps,
Pyrenees, and other high mountains immediately
below the region of perpetual
snow. It is about the size of a hare, of
a yellowish green color, tinted with an
ashen hue about the head; the upper
lip is cleft and whiskered. Marmots live
in families, who mutually aid each other
in excavating a common dwelling,--a
chamber lined with dried grass, at the
end of a passage, six or eight feet, in the
form of the letter Y, one of the branches
serving as an entrance, the other as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>
sewer. During winter, the mouth is
closed by earth. They feed in company,
but always place a sentinel, who, on the
first appearance of danger, utters a shrill
cry, when the whole retreat.</p>

<h2>THE KOODOO.</h2>


<p>The Koodoo combines many of the
characteristics of the sheep, ox, and antelope.
He is a large and beautiful animal,
a native of the woodlands of Caffraria,
the male standing four feet high, and
from the insertion of the tail to the
muzzle measuring about eight. The
horns rise perpendicularly in large spiral
whorls, three feet nine inches in length;
a bristling of black hairs runs along the
ridge of the neck, and a line of the same
color hangs from the dewlap: the general
color is brown, fading into grey, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>
a dorsal stripe of white, and stripes of
the same color behind the shoulders and
across the back. They are fleet but can
not run long.</p>

<p>More nearly allied to the deer, from
which they are distinguished by their
horns being permanent and without
antlers, but marked with circular elevated
rings, which increase, in size with their
growth and years, one or two species
alone exhibit a short ramification.</p>

<h2>THE MOUFFLON.</h2>


<p>This is a sort of sheep living wild on
the mountains of Corsica and Sardinia; a
similar species is also scattered over
European Turkey and some of the islands
of the Archipelago. They are about the
ordinary size of sheep, and breed with
the domestic races. The head is long,
with the muzzle compressed, the nose
somewhat raised, and the forehead
swollen; the horns of the male (the female
being without) are large, long, and
triangular, bending backward like a half
circle, attenuated from the base to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>
tip, which is obtuse; the body is large
and muscular, the tail short, and bare
on the inside; the legs are pretty long,
and the hoofs short.</p>

<p>They wander in flocks of about a hundred,
led by some old and courageous
male. Their habits are like those of our
own sheep, docile and gentle, though
sometimes an amorous or a churlish old
ram will butt down a child, a woman, or
a man, who may happen to stand in his
road, when the fit is upon him.</p>

<h2>THE RED DEER.</h2>


<p>The European Stag, or Red Deer, is a
fine looking animal, the tallest of the
deer kind. The pride of the north, he delights
in the highest mountains and the
thickest forests, and is famed for long
life, though the natural term of his existence
be often exaggerated, and which,
when exposed to human observation, he
has never yet been accurately known to
reach. He comes to full growth at five
years, when his horns send out as many
antlers, and he is called a hart, and the
female a hind.</p>

<p>Every year the male sheds his horns,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>
and conscious of his temporary weakness,
hides himself till his new ones are hardened.
His color, as his name imports,
is a bright reddish-brown, of a darker
shade near the belly, which is white.
When fatigued in the chase, he takes the
water if near, and will cross with ease
considerable and rapid streams; when
wounded or taken, he sheds tears like a
child; but though timid, when at bay
he sometimes takes ample vengeance
upon the hounds before he is subdued.</p>

<h2>THE LION.</h2>


<p>The African Lion, now driven from the
coast, is scattered over the interior. He
measures from seven to nine feet in
length, with a tail about four, tufted at
the point; the height at the shoulder
from three to five; but when he is newly
whelped, his size does not exceed that of
a puppy dog, and it requires four, or according
to some writers, six years, till
he attains his full stature. He lives to
a great but uncertain age; one in the
Tower reached upwards of seventy years.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>
There are three varieties described;
one of a deep yellowish brown; the other
of a lighter shade: and the Cape Lion,
of which the mane is nearly black. The
appearance of the lion, from which he
has derived the title of the king of beasts,
is majestic when at rest, but terrible
when roused. He has a broad face, surrounded
with long shaggy hair, and a
flowing mane, increasing in length as
his years advance, adorns his neck.</p>

<h2>THE LLAMA.</h2>


<p>The Llama of the New are analogous
to the camel of the Old World, but
smaller in size, being only about four
feet four inches high at the shoulder.
The dromedary is from five to seven. It
is a native of the mountainous regions
of South America. It has cloven hoofs,
adapted for aiding its progress in hilly
districts. It has no hunch on the back,
but has one on the breast. Its color is
a greyish-white, spotted. It is equally
abstemious in its habits with the camel,
and will travel four or even five days
without seeking repose; but like the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span>
camel, it will not be forced to carry more
or move faster than it chooses and will
rather kill itself, by striking its head on
the ground, than be driven forward by
harshness or blows. In a wild state it
is gregarious, but is easily domesticated,
and is still used as a beast of burden.</p>
